# PavlovBox
##Website for First Hackathon Project

###Idea

Pavlov's Fridge is an idea where you have an unlockable fridge (or just a box). It could hold your rewards, credit cards for obsessive shoppers, snacks, dog food, etc. 

How do you unlock it?
  You complete tasks.
  
Tasks? What tasks?
  These tasks are created online through this website. You submit the tasks that you want to accomplish before you open the fridge, and you're done!
  
It's locked. What do I do? 
  Complete the tasks! Dishonest people would just tick all of these tasks and unlock the fridge anyway..

###Website Features

-Amazing Comic on the side to keep you entertained
-Enter tasks (max of 19 tasks).
-Tasks are tickable and completion is represented on the percentage bar.
-You may only unlock the fridge when it is 100% complete. It can be already complete but you haven't clicked unlock.
-These tasks show up on the screen unless you refresh.
-Website sends a value, 0 or 1, to Firebase. The box reads this value and updates itself accordingly.
  1 refers to open, 0 is closed.

###Notes

I wrote this at my first hackathon, with no knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Through motivation to not let the group down and free coffee, I stayed up all night to create this website.

It's not responsive since the main objective was just to get it to work.
